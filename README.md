🦀 This repository is a collection of practical Rust programming exercises, examples, and notes

## Why use Rust?
Rust is a programming language that has an extremely strict type system.
Rust Goals:-
- Speed: Rust's binaries are as fast as C binaries, sometimes outpacing C++ binaries!
- Memory safety: Rust has a huge emphasis on memory safety.
- Concurrency: Focusing on memory safety eliminates a lot of race condition-like scenarios and helps you introduce concurrency in your program.

Following are a few errors mistakes one might make in languages like C/C++ (but not with Rust):

- Use after free
- Double free
- Accessing out-of-bound values
- Using ```NULL```
- Inappropriate pointer arithmetic and/or access
- Use of uninitialized variable(s)
- Thread-unsafe multi-threading
